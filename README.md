## Book-store-react-app

![](https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/star-wars-react-app/blob/master/readme-image.png)

Deployed todo-react-app here [Book-store](https://plevakovitalii.github.io/star-wars-react-app/star-wars-react/).

Implemented functionality:

- receiving data from a local file of your choice and storing it in a state;
- transition between pages without reloading;
- React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- react-router-dom
- redux
- react-redux
- npm gh-pages

All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/book-store-react-app.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
